# About Data

This mushroom dataset consists of 23 attributes and 8123 observations. The independent attributes describe the mushrooms and dependent attribute describes their edibility (poisonous and edible).

The mushroom attributes can be determined by inspecting the mushroom with little to no measuring equipment/tools. Such attributes include the description of the cap (shape, surface and color), gill (attachment, spacing, etc.), and the description of where the mushroom was found (habitat and mushroom population).

The dataset has not been cleaned/processed. There are missing values in the set. All of the variables are categorical.
