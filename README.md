# SVM And ANN Mushroom Edibility Classification

This is a classification problem that uses two black box machine learning models to classify the edibility of mushrooms. The models used here are the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

The dataset used contains 23 variables (including edibility) that describe the characteristics of mushrooms from two families (Agicarus and Lepiota Family).
